# Dev log 1: Ground zero

## Part 1: Serve the Server

First things first, I had to set up the Rust server; for this I used actix. I did this by simply starting a new cargo project using ```cargo new server```, which scaffolded the start of the project.

I then added the following dependencies in the Cargo.toml file:

```
[dependencies]
actix = "0.13.3"
actix-cors = "0.7.0"
actix-web = "4.5.1"
actix-web-actors = "4.3.0"
serde = "1.0.201"
serde_derive = "1.0.201"
serde_json = "1.0.117"
```

Actix is of course used for the backend framework, and was chosen based on the performance and scalability capabilities it has. I like that the actor architecture lets me scale across threads or servers, cause scalability *definitely* matters for this toy project. Really, their docs had the most understandable WebSocket demo that my smooth brain picked up quickly. I added Serde and associated packages to deal with JSON data coming from the frontend too, that way it fits nicely into some structs & enums.

Lets go ahead and set up that server, first I'll go over the websocket implementation which as it stands now is just an echo connection; ie whatever we send into it just gets spit back out. This is really just a clone from the actix example [here](https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/websockets/echo), but let's walk through it anyway.

```rust
// heartbeat ping frequency
const HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: Duration = Duration::from_secs(5);

// how long until timeout
const CLIENT_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(10);
```
Here, we're just defining how often we are completing a "heartbeat" in the websocket, which i've learned is just a quick ping to see if the connection is still active. Client timeout is just the time until disconnect if the heartbeat doesn't work.
```rust
pub struct HiveSocket {
    hb: Instant,
}

impl HiveSocket {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self { hb: Instant::now() }
    }

    fn hb(&self, ctx: &mut <Self as Actor>::Context) {
        ctx.run_interval(HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL, |act, ctx| {

            // check heartbeat of clients
            if Instant::now().duration_since(act.hb) > CLIENT_TIMEOUT {
                // heartbeat timed out
                println!("Websocket Client heartbeat failed, disconnecting");

                // stop actor
                ctx.stop();

                // dont send ping
                return;
            }

            ctx.ping(b"");
        });
    }
}
```
Here we're first defining the HiveSocket struct itself, which is only worried about it's heartbeat. When we instantiate a new HiveSocket object, it gets a heartbeat at the time of creation. In the hb function, we are essentially setting up the heartbeat process by calling the ```run_interval``` method on ctx; this is just a recurring timer that executes the code block over a regular interval. All the other logic basically sends a silly little ping pong message to update the heartbeat; unless it's been a while since the last heartbeat, in which case the websocket disconnects and stops the actor. Some of this is still witchcraft to me.

```rust
impl Actor for HiveSocket {
    type Context = ws::WebsocketContext<Self>;
    
    // method called on actor start; heartbeat process starts here
    fn started(&mut self, ctx: &mut Self::Context) {
        self.hb(ctx);
    }
}
```

This implements the Actor trait on our shiny new socket, and does so in the following steps:

- Defines the context in which this actor will run; which I guess makes sense it's websocketcontext.
- The heartbeat process is then started on initialization. My lack of experience makes me think why not just have this in the ```new()``` method of the HiveSocket itself, but I assume it's done this way to be used as an actor specifically.

```rust
impl StreamHandler<Result<ws::Message, ws::ProtocolError>> for HiveSocket {
    fn handle(&mut self, msg: Result<ws::Message, ws::ProtocolError>, ctx: &mut Self::Context) {

        println!("WS: {msg:?}");
        match msg {
            Ok(ws::Message::Ping(msg)) => {
                self.hb = Instant::now();
                ctx.pong(&msg);
            }
            Ok(ws::Message::Pong(_)) => {
                self.hb = Instant::now();
            }
            Ok(ws::Message::Text(text)) => {
                ctx.text(text);

            },
            Ok(ws::Message::Binary(bin)) => ctx.binary(bin),
            Ok(ws::Message::Close(reason)) => {
                ctx.close(reason);
                ctx.stop();
            }
            _ => ctx.stop(),
        }
    }
}
```
Now we can handle streams! I guess my question is how do people know what traits you have to implement to do what? I assume be a good dev and look at the docs right? Anyways, ```handle``` takes in a message, along with the context of the current actor, and does a simple match statement (we'll also print it, for now). The ping-pong messages just update the heartbeat to ensure connection, and text/binary messages are sent to the websocket in context. The websocket can also close if it receives a closing message.

Now that we have the socket set up, we can start to serve the server itself!
```rust
// ws handshake and start HiveSocket actor
async fn echo_ws(req: HttpRequest, stream: web::Payload) -> Result<HttpResponse, Error> {
    ws::start(HiveSocket::new(), &req, stream)
}
```

First we define the ```echo_ws``` service as a function that simply starts the websocket. Easy enough.

```rust
#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        let cors = Cors::default()
            .allowed_origin(ALLOWED_ORIGIN)
            .allowed_methods(vec!["GET", "POST"])
            .allowed_headers(vec![http::header::AUTHORIZATION, http::header::ACCEPT])
            .allowed_header(http::header::CONTENT_TYPE)
            .max_age(3600);
        App::new()
            .wrap(cors)
            .service(web::resource("/ws").route(web::get().to(echo_ws)))
    })
    .bind("0.0.0.0:8080")
    .expect("Server error")
    .run()
    .await
}
```

The websocket is now being served! that ```.service``` method is where we're actually setting up the socket, the rest is essentially setting up the server itself on port 8080, as well as setting up CORS so we can actually access it from the React frontend. Speaking of the frontend, let's get on that. 

## Part 2: A Glorified textarea

I started the project using the usual ```create-react-app``` and ```--template typescript```. I hear types are good so we're doing types. 
```ts
import ReactQuill from 'react-quill';
import 'react-quill/dist/quill.snow.css';
import useWebSocket, {ReadyState} from 'react-use-websocket';
```
We're using QuillJS for the components relating to text editing, mainly because of their "Delta" feature, which we will use for making changes to files on the server, but more on that later. We're also using useWebSocket for our websocket connections.
```ts
function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");
  const socketUrl = "ws://localhost:8080/ws";
  const {sendMessage, lastMessage, readyState} = useWebSocket(socketUrl);

  const connectionStatus = {
    [ReadyState.CONNECTING]: 'Connecting',
    [ReadyState.OPEN]: 'Connected',
    [ReadyState.CLOSING]: 'Closing',
    [ReadyState.CLOSED]: 'Closed',
    [ReadyState.UNINSTANTIATED]: 'Uninstantiated',
  }[readyState];

  function handleChange(content: any, delta: any, source:any, editor:any) {
    sendMessage(JSON.stringify(delta));
    setValue(content);
  }
  ...
```
We have a simple "value" state that tracks the contents of the text in the editing window, a socket URL that points to our Rust websocket, and a deconstruction from useWebSocket. Briefly:
- sendMessage is just a method to send a message to the socket,
- lastMessage gets the last message sent,
- and readyState tells us whats going on in terms of status.

connectionStatus is just used to display the status of our connection to the user.

handleChange sends a JSON message of the delta taking place on a specific edit. It's worth explaining deltas now: These are just objects representing changes; defined as an operation along with an associated character or number. There are three:
- insert: Inserts a specific character. shown as ```{"insert": "H"}``` for example.
- retain: Moves cursor to a specific position in the text editing window. ```{"retain": 8}``` would move us to the 9th spot, because 0-indexing etc.
- delete: Deletes characters from the position of the cursor back. ```{"delete": 4}``` would delete the 4 characters preceeding the current cursor position.

This is what we really want, as rewriting the entire document on every change would be super cumbersome and not viable with multiple users interacting with the document at the same time; and allows us to use CRDTs or OTs like Google Docs.

```ts
...
return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hive</h1>
      <div className="editorContainer">
        <ReactQuill theme="snow" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      </div>
      <h6>Status: {connectionStatus} </h6>
    </div>
  );
...
```
We end up rendering a nice text editor thanks to Quill, and a status message to show us what's going on with that socket. Here's what it looks like!

![Hive version 0.00001](./images/hive_gui.png)

Wow. Truly breathtaking design.

Let's write "Hi" then delete it and see what our websocket spits out.

```
WS: Ok(Text("{\"ops\":[{\"insert\":\"H\"}]}"))
WS: Ok(Text("{\"ops\":[{\"retain\":1},{\"insert\":\"i\"}]}"))
WS: Ok(Text("{\"ops\":[{\"retain\":1},{\"delete\":1}]}"))
WS: Ok(Text("{\"ops\":[{\"delete\":1}]}"))
WS: Ok(Pong(b""))
WS: Ok(Pong(b""))
WS: Ok(Pong(b""))
WS: Ok(Pong(b""))
```

The first 4 messages show the operations taking place in Quill, were we insert the characters, then delete them, along with the offset defined in retain operations. The rest are the ping/pong messages to see if it's still alive. Cool!

## Progress

✅ First websocket

✅ First Rust backend

✅ A tiny bit of understanding of what's happening


## Next Steps
Now we have to structure the data coming in from these messages into usable data strucutures. That's why we included Serde in the dependencies. (I looked at the docs once and I'm extremely confused)

Until next time!
