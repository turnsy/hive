# Devlog 2: We have collaborative editing!
Much has been done since the first devlog, so this entry is going to be long winded. At a high level, the following has been completed:
- The server now facilitates multiple connections in a single socket server instance
- We have a random text file that can be edited by each user connected to the server
- These changes are reflected live on the frontend by broadcasting messages to all other users
- On initial load, we connect and load the current state of the document.

I'm going to step through each of these and explain how it was done, but first at a high level the architecture of the app as it currently stands:

## Part 1: Text editing, with friends
### We Need a room.
This first big step was changing how we facilitate connections to the websocket server. For this, we'll need both the server itself and sessions for incoming users. We want to be able to broadcast messages to all the users connected on a given file change, as well as handle connections/disconnections that occur. First let's define the server itself:
```rust
pub struct HiveSocketServer {
    pub sessions: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<usize, Recipient<BroadcastMessage>>>>,
    pub next_id: Arc<Mutex<usize>>,
}
```
Here, `sessions` just holds all of our currently active sessions, in the form of Recipients of the broadcast message. More on this later. `next_id` is used for generating IDs for each session, to distinguish them from eachother. The constructor of this is self explanatory, but it just intializes the hash map and a `next_id` of 0. There's a few different types of messages implemented here, so I'll go through those now:
```rust
#[derive(Message)]
#[rtype(result = "()")]
struct Connect {
    addr: Recipient<BroadcastMessage>,
    id: usize,
}

#[derive(Message)]
#[rtype(result = "()")]
struct Disconnect {
    id: usize,
}

#[derive(Message, Clone)]
#[rtype(result = "()")]
pub struct BroadcastMessage {
    msg: String,
    src_addr: Recipient<BroadcastMessage>,
}
#[derive(Message)]
#[rtype(result = "usize")]
pub struct GenerateId;
```
These are all just derived from the `Message` derivation provided from actix. `Connect` and `Disconnect` make use of `id` to reference specific recipients, and `Connect` has `addr` to set up the actual connection from client to server. `BroadcastMessage` is used to send messages out to all users, so it's important to know where it is coming from; that's what `src_addr` is for.
```rust
impl Handler<Connect> for HiveSocketServer {
    type Result = ();

    fn handle(&mut self, msg: Connect, _: &mut Self::Context) {
        self.sessions.lock().unwrap().insert(msg.id, msg.addr);
    }
}

impl Handler<Disconnect> for HiveSocketServer {
    type Result = ();

    fn handle(&mut self, msg: Disconnect, _: &mut Self::Context) {
        self.sessions.lock().unwrap().remove(&msg.id);
    }
}
```

When implementing `Connect` and `Disconnect`, we are simply just adding an entry to the sessions map, or deleting one; based on the `id` value passed. To facilitate concurrency, these are of course held in mutex objects.

```rust
impl Handler<BroadcastMessage> for HiveSocketServer {
    type Result = ();

    fn handle(&mut self, msg: BroadcastMessage, _: &mut Self::Context) {
        for addr in self.sessions.lock().unwrap().values() {
            // check that source address does not match the one being sent to.
            if *addr != msg.src_addr {
                addr.do_send(msg.clone());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To handle broadcasted messages, we want to send the message to everyone except the user who sent the message; this is because the change is MADE from the source user, so that user already sees the change in the frontend. All this takes is a quick addressing check.

```rust
impl Handler<GenerateId> for HiveSocketServer {
    type Result = MessageResult<GenerateId>;

    fn handle(&mut self, _: GenerateId, _: &mut Self::Context) -> Self::Result {
        let mut id = self.next_id.lock().unwrap();
        *id += 1;
        MessageResult(*id)
    }
}
```

Here, we are just generating IDs for created sessions. The locking taking place on `next_id` is just to ensure no two sessions contain the same ID.

### We need *friends* for the room.
The structure for sessions in our websocket server is pretty simple for now!
```rust
pub struct HiveSocketSession {
    pub id: usize,
    pub addr: Addr<HiveSocketServer>,
}
```
`id` is just the id assigned from the `GenerateId` message in the above implementation, and `addr` is just he address of the session. Actix uses the Actor model, which [allows applications to be written as a group of independently executing but cooperating "Actors" which communicate via messages](https://actix.rs/docs/actix/actor/). This has a couple benefits, Actors are inherently concurrent which is great for our web socket use case, and they're isolated which avoids race conditions. All very important for concurrent edits in our little markdown editor! The two functions that matter to us are `started` and `stopping`, which run when an actor is created and destroyed respectively. 

```rust
impl Actor for HiveSocketSession {
    type Context = ws::WebsocketContext<Self>;

    fn started(&mut self, ctx: &mut Self::Context) {
        let addr = ctx.address();
        self.addr
            .send(Connect {
                addr: addr.recipient(),
                id: self.id,
            })
            .into_actor(self)
            .then(|_, _, _| fut::ready(()))
            .wait(ctx);

        // Load the document from the file
        let f_path = Path::new("./files/test.txt");
        let f_string = fs::read_to_string(f_path).unwrap();
        let message = SocketMessage {
            variant: MesssageVariant::Document,
            content: f_string,
        };
        ctx.text(serde_json::to_string(&message).unwrap());
    }

    fn stopping(&mut self, _: &mut Self::Context) -> Running {
        self.addr.do_send(Disconnect { id: self.id });
        Running::Stop
    }
}
```
In `started`, first we fire off the `Connect` message to the server, which adds this session's `recipient` to the session map. We then convert this request into an actor, then wait for the connection to complete before proceeding. Following that, we fire off a socket message to the connecting client with the contents of the file `test.txt`, as for now we're just working with a single file. In `stopping`, we just send a `Disconnect` message, removing the session from the server's session map, return the stopped Actor's state. Next, this session needs to know how to handle broadcasted messages, since we defined a separate struct for that; that implementation is below:

```rust
impl Handler<BroadcastMessage> for HiveSocketSession {
    type Result = ();

    fn handle(&mut self, msg: BroadcastMessage, ctx: &mut Self::Context) {
        ctx.text(msg.msg);
    }
}
```
All we're doing is taking the message from the broadcast, and sending it to the session. Simple!

Next, our sessions need to know how to handle messages in general; that's what the `StreamHandler` is for. But to explain how this was handled, first I need to explain Deltas.
# Part 2: What's a Delta?
In QuillJS, the text editor chosen for this project, changes are represented by "Deltas". These can have one of three forms, including:
- insert: which simply inserts a character
- retain: which moves to a given index
- delete: which can delete any number of characters, from a given retained position.

Say we had the string `"Hello"`, which we now want to add `"!"` to. Each inserted character would take the form:
```json
[
  {
    "retain": 6
  },
  {
    "insert": "!"
  }
]
```
Where `"retain"` moves us to index `6`, and `"insert"` inserts the character `"!"`. For a more comprehensive explanation of deltas, see QuillJS's playground where you can interact with a textarea and see the given delta [here](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/).
So then, on any given change we can take this list of delta operations and send them as a message to the server to make an update to the file. To parse these messages into usable objects, we will be using the go-to crate for this, Serde.
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]
enum Operation {
    Insert(String),
    Delete(usize),
    Retain(usize),
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct OperationData {
    ops: Vec<Operation>,
}
```

Here, we simply define an atomic operation we can recieve from the delta message, as an emum of the three different operations. These are held in `OperationData`, which acts as a wrapper for the vector of operations we recieve on any given delta message from the front end. The derivations made on these classes are simply to parse the message as we recieve it in plain text from the client; the magic of Serde!

```rust
fn apply_operations(op_data: OperationData, f_string: &mut String) {
    let mut cursor: usize = 0;

    for op in op_data.ops {
        match op {
            Operation::Insert(c) => f_string.insert_str(cursor, &c),
            Operation::Retain(offset) => {
                cursor = offset;
            }
            Operation::Delete(amount) => {
                f_string.drain(cursor..(cursor + amount));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This function is what we use to perform operations on a given string. `op_data` is our list of operations, and `f_string` is the string that we are modifying with these operations. (Note: I understand how efficient this is for now, as with larger files grabbing the entire file as a string will be *quite* slow. That's for another dev log). Inside the function, we are just imitating the different operations using methods on the string. We need to now use this with the messages we recieve from the client, and that's what the next function will do:

```rust
pub fn handle_op_message(data: &[u8]) -> Result<String, Error> {
    // convert byte string to utf8
    let data_as_str = std::str::from_utf8(data).unwrap();

    // convert to OperationalData (just a vector wrapper)
    let op_data: OperationData = serde_json::from_str(data_as_str).unwrap();

    // get our current state of the file being edited, read it into a string
    let f_path = Path::new("./files/test.txt");
    let mut f_string = fs::read_to_string(f_path).unwrap();

    // apply operations to the current file
    apply_operations(op_data, &mut f_string);

    // write to the file
    fs::write(f_path, f_string).unwrap();

    Ok(String::from(data_as_str))
}
```

Here, we take in our message as a ByteString array, and parse it to a `OperationalData` object. We then load in the file being edited as a string, and perform the message's operations on it! Yes yes I know inefficient but this is just for proof of concept. We then write the new file contents, and return the original message- more on why later.

Now with that in place, we can go over the `StreamHandler` for our sessions.
```rust
impl StreamHandler<Result<ws::Message, ws::ProtocolError>> for HiveSocketSession {
    fn handle(&mut self, msg: Result<ws::Message, ws::ProtocolError>, ctx: &mut Self::Context) {
        match msg {
            Ok(ws::Message::Text(text)) => {
                // applies operation to file on backend
                match handle_op_message(text.as_ref()) {
                    Ok(msg) => {
                        // successful edit, broadcast change to other connected users
                        let delta_message = SocketMessage {
                            variant: MessageVariant::Delta,
                            content: msg,
                        };
                        let delta_message_str = serde_json::to_string(&delta_message).unwrap();

                        let src_addr = ctx.address().recipient();
                        self.addr.do_send(BroadcastMessage {
                            msg: delta_message_str,
                            src_addr,
                        });
                    }
                    Err(_) => {
                        // error making edit, thus we send error message back to frontend
                        let error_message = SocketMessage {
                            variant: MessageVariant::Error,
                            content: "Internal server error".to_string(),
                        };
                        ctx.text(serde_json::to_string(&error_message).unwrap());
                    }
                };
            }
            _ => ctx.stop(),
        }
    }
}
```
Yeah I know it's a lot. All we're *really* doing here is handling messages they come from the client, into the session and eventual server. On a text based message to the server, we apply the delta change to the file we're editing, and then broadcasting the delta back out to all the other clients connected *except* for the client that sent it; that's why we made `BroadcastMessage`! If there was an error making the change, then we just send back an error message. I'm alright with HTTP methods and error codes but websockets feel like the wild west. You may have noticed the `MessageVariant` being used for different messages, this is simply done so the frontend can discern different messages and complete the right tasks upon recieving them. The definition for this is below:
```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum MessageVariant {
    Delta,
    Document,
    IncomingConnection,
    Error,
}
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct SocketMessage {
    pub variant: MessageVariant,
    pub content: String,
}
```

Again, this was done so we have structured data being sent back to the client, making use of Serde's serialization derivations.

Great! Now that we have that, we can handle messages as they come in from the client, make changes to the file with each character change, and that those changes propogated to other users connected to the server. All that's left is the frontend!
# Part 3: Putting it all together
For the frontend, the challenge came from interacting with the QuillJS API and handling messages correctly so no infinite loops occurred. Here are some important changes to our `App.tsx` file:

```tsx
// get reference to quill editor
const editorRef = useRef<ReactQuill>(null);
...
<ReactQuill theme="snow" onChange={handleChange} ref={editorRef} />
```

Here, we have to grab a reference to the `ReactQuill` component to interact with any of the API methods that QuillJS provides. What does that `handleChange` function do?

```tsx
// handleChange is used to actually fire off the websocket messages,
// whenever a user makes a change themselves
function handleChange(_value: string, delta: DeltaStatic, source: any, _editor: any) {
  if (source === "user") {
    sendMessage(JSON.stringify(delta));
  }
}
```

One of ReactQuill's props allows us to modify the function that handles changes in the editor. This provides us with 4 arguments, though `delta` and `source` are the only important ones in this case. The if statement ensures that the change comes from the user themselves, as changes given from the server *also* count as changes which would then fire off another message to the server, and there's that infinite loop we were talking about. `sendMessage` just sends a message with the delta of the change that just occured; that's why we set up everything to handle deltas in the server. For messages incoming, they are handled as follows:
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
    if (lastMessage !== null) {
      handleSocketMessage(lastMessage, editorRef);
    }
  }, [lastMessage])
```
Where we call `handleSocketMessage` on the last message, if it exists. That function does the following:
```tsx
export function handleSocketMessage(message: MessageEvent<any>, quillRef: React.RefObject<ReactQuill>) {
    const message_JSON = JSON.parse(message.data);

    switch(message_JSON.variant) {

        case MessageVariant.Document:
            quillRef.current?.editor?.setText(message_JSON.content);
            break;

        case MessageVariant.Delta:
            const delta: DeltaStatic = JSON.parse(message_JSON.content);
            quillRef.current?.editor?.updateContents(delta, "api");
            break;

        case MessageVariant.Error:
            console.log("Internal Server Error");
            break;
    }
}
```
This switch statement was the reason for message variants! Now we can handle `Document` messages, which load up the initial state of the document on connection, using the `setText` method provided by Quill. When we get a `Delta` message from the server, we just use `updateContents` to apply the delta, using a `DeltaStatic` object, which took way too long to figure out. Judging by the import path, I don't think it actually ever wanted to be found.

```tsx
import { DeltaStatic } from '../../node_modules/react-quill/node_modules/@types/quill/index';
```

So we have a working collaborative markdown editor! How about a quick demo?
[VIDEO]

Great! So we accomplished what we wanted, multiple clients can edit the file at once, and those edits are shown on all clients; with saving occuring after each change. For next steps:
- Use a file system for holding multiple files. This will likely be done by using a database with document IDs and paths, which will represent the hierarchy of any given project.
- A markdown renderer to show changes as they occur. I have some ideas to make the editor make use of the toolbar in markdown, ie automatically adding *italics* or _bold text_. Could be fun!
- Revamping the handling of operations, with two focal points: 1: String manipulation is slow and bad. Fix that. 2: Build in operational transformations or CRDTs, so there are no conflicts (super hard)


Thanks for tuning in!
